# About Emma

I am a graduate of Haverford College (class of 2021), having majored in Biology and minored in Environmental Studies. Currently, I am a Master's Student in the Department of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture at Colorado State University, studying Urban Forestry.

# Research 

My research investigates the relationship between urban forestry, specifically street trees, and public transportation.

# Experience

After graduating college, I completed a service term with Green Iowa Americorps in Linn County's Sustainability Department. During my service term, I worked with local community organizations to develop educational events and environmental engagement opportunities.

After my Americorps service term, I was a researcher in the Environmental Design Lab in the Department of Planning and Landscape Architecture at UW-Madison. As a researcher, I worked on qualatiative research, investigating the relationship between mental health and the university's campus.

Please feel free to [reach out](mailto:emma.castiblanco@colostate.edu) if you want to chat trees, sustainability or discuss potential projects.
